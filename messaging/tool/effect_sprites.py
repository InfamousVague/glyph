"""
Cuts the effects' sprite sheets (docs/effect-sprites-prompt.md) into the sprites the app moves (lib/effects.dart).

Matt, 2026-11-13: "the ghost messages assets are on the desktop, please wire them all and slice them up".

    python3 tool/effect_sprites.py ~/Desktop/ghost_messages_assets      keeps the sheets in art/effects/, then cuts
    python3 tool/effect_sprites.py                                      cuts the sheets already in art/effects/

A sheet is kept as a WebP that loses nothing of what is drawn (art/effects/balloons.webp), with the remover's halo
already cleared: that halo is two thirds of a sheet's weight as a PNG, and it is the first thing cut away here anyway.

A sheet is a square picture, named for its effect (balloons.png), of about twelve separate sprites on a clear
background: ghost characters in the top row, small props under them. Each sprite is found by its shape, not by a
grid: what is solid is gathered into pieces that touch, pieces a short way apart are one sprite (a ghost and the
little dashes drawn round it), and a speck on its own is dropped. The faint halo a background remover leaves round a
sprite (nearly clear pixels of any colour) is cut away first.

Written to assets/effects/: <effect>-h1.webp… for the top row's characters and <effect>-p1.webp… for the props,
which is how the app tells them apart; and to build/effect-sprites/, one picture of each sheet's cuts to look over.
