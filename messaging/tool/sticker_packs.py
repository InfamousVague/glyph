Makes the app's sticker packs (lib/stickers.dart) from the ghost drawn for the message effects.

Matt, 2026-11-13: "generate 4 sticker packs using our ghost mascot we've developed including a sanrio one".

    python3 tool/sticker_packs.py
    python3 tool/sticker_packs.py mischief="~/Desktop/Mischief sticker sheet.png"     keeps a pack's own sheet, then makes all
    python3 tool/sticker_packs.py mischief=~/Desktop/AnimatedStickers                 makes that pack's stickers move

The ghost's poses are the characters on the effects' sheets (art/effects/, cut by tool/effect_sprites.py, whose
cutting this uses at the sheets' full size). A sticker is one pose with a sticker's white edge round it, on a clear
square. Four packs, sixteen each:

    ghost   the everyday ones: hello, boo, wow, sorry, coffee, asleep
    love    hearts, kisses, flowers
    party   confetti, balloons, fireworks, music
    sweet   the pastel one: the ghost in soft pink, lilac, mint, butter and sky, with little hearts, flowers and
            sparkles. It is our own ghost in the cute pastel manner Matt asked for by naming Sanrio; none of Sanrio's
            characters, names or drawings are in it, since those are Sanrio's and not ours to ship.

A fifth pack is drawn for itself and not made from the effects (Matt, 2026-11-13: "sliced ... the sticker pack
from the desktop"): **mischief**, the dark-cute one, our ghost with little horns and a heart-tipped tail in black,
purple and hot pink. Its sheet is sixteen stickers, four across and four down, kept in art/stickers/mischief.webp
(nothing drawn is lost, the background remover's halo cleared) and cut by shape (effect_sprites.cut_grid).

Mischief moves (Matt, 2026-11-14: "Update the sticker pack to use the animated sprites from the desktop"): given a
folder in place of a sheet, with one file for each sticker ("Sticker 07 cherry bomb - sprite sheet.png", the sticker
drawn six times, three across and two down), each is cut into its six drawings, laid in one frame as they stood,
given the white edge, and written as an animated PNG, assets/stickers/mischief/07.png: one file that is the sticker
in the app and what is sent. An animated PNG moves on an iPhone and in this app, and is an ordinary still picture
(its first drawing) to anything that does not know the kind, with its clear edge kept either way; a GIF would move
everywhere but has no soft edge and 256 colours a frame. A pack that has been made to move is left as it is when
the tool is run without its folder: the drawings (44 MB) are Matt's and are not in the repository.

Written to assets/stickers/<pack>/01.webp…, and to build/stickers/, one picture of each pack to look over.
A pack's order here is its order in the app.
