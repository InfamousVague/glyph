/**
 * How two phones with Ghost Messaging find each other (Matt, 2026-11-13: "I'd like to instead be able to detect if
 * both users are using ghost messaging and enable encryption in the chat", then "If we detect both users are using
 * ghost it should show a banner that can be dismissed asking the user to enable encryption for better security").
 * There is no server to ask, so the app says it is there in the texts themselves: three invisible characters at the
 * end of a text, which another copy of the app recognises and every other app draws as nothing. Pure JVM
 * ([GhostMarkTest]).
 *
 * The mark rides only where it costs nothing: on a text that stays the same number of SMS with it (the sender
 * checks), at most once a day to a person, and never on a text another phone reads to the letter (a reaction, one of
 * this app's own `ghost:` texts). It is only a hello: it carries no key, proves nothing, and nothing is sent because
 * of it. A phone that sees it remembers that the person has the app, and their conversation then offers encryption
 * in a banner, which the person turns on or dismisses.
