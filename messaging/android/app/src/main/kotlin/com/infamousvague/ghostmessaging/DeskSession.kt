 * One connection from a paired computer, as the phone answers it (docs/desktop.md). It knows nothing of sockets:

 * are the same to it, and it runs on the JVM under test (DeskSessionTest) with a made-up phone behind it.
 *
 * A connection goes: the computer's hello in the clear (which pairing, a random number, a throwaway public key),
 * the phone's hello back, and from then sealed frames only ([DeskCrypto.Channel]). The computer's first sealed
 * frame, `ready`, is what shows it holds the pairing's key: nothing is answered before it. Then the computer asks
