/**
 * Friends: the phone's half (lib/friends/friends.dart is the rest). Matt, 2026-11-14: "Add a friend system that
 * allows users to talk without using SMS or MMS but still validate accounts by telephone numbers for now. If both
 * users chatting are on ghost messenger show an 'add friend' button".
 *
 * Two people are friends once each has said so. A friend is someone encryption is on with: exchanging keys by text
 * is what proved each number to the other, and where the two stand is kept on that same record ([E2e.friend]), so
 * it ends when encryption with them does. What friends write goes by the app's routes (lib/net: the relay server
 * first), not as a text.
 *
 * What is here:
 * - A friend's words are **kept with the phone's own messages**, as a text is: the conversation, the list, search,
 *   notifications and a paired computer show them with no second store to read. They are kept sealed, as an
 *   encrypted text is. Which rows came or went by the routes is remembered apart ([isNet]) so the screen can say.
 * - **The wake.** A message the relay server is keeping for a friend whose app is closed is followed by one data
 *   text ([isWake]): nothing is in it, and it is on no screen. The phone it reaches says a message is waiting; the
 *   message itself is fetched when the app opens.
