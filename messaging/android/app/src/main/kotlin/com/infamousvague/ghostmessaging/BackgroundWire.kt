/**
 * A chat's background as it travels between phones that both run Ghost Messaging (Matt, 2026-11-13: "I want the
 * background to sync for everyone in a chat if they're all using ghost messaging"). There is no server: it goes as a
 * text in the conversation itself, which this app draws as a line ("Maya changed the chat background") and wears,
 * and which any other app would show as its letters. Pure JVM, so [BackgroundWireTest] holds it.
 *
 * `ghost:bg1:` and one of:
 * - `none`: the plain page.
 * - `preset:dusk`: one of the app's washes, by its name (lib/backgrounds.dart).
 * - `color:#RRGGBB`: one colour.
 * - `wash:#RRGGBB,#RRGGBB,#RRGGBB,#RRGGBB`: a wash's top and bottom in the light theme, then in the dark: what
 *   "Match my wallpaper" is on the phone that sent it, since the other phone's wallpaper is its own.
 * - `image`: the picture is the picture of the same message (an MMS).
