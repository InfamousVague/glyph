# Ghost Messaging effect sprites: prompts for Nano Banana 3

Twenty-one images: one reference sheet of the ghost, then one sprite sheet for each of the twenty message effects.

An image model makes stills, not animation, so these are **sprites**: separate little pictures on a flat background.
The app cuts each sheet into its sprites and moves them itself (rising, falling, bursting), in place of the emoji and
plain shapes it draws today.

## How to use this

1. Settings for every image: **aspect ratio 1:1**, the **highest resolution** on offer (2K or 4K), PNG.
2. Generate **0. The reference sheet** first. Keep it.
3. For each effect, start a new request, **attach the reference sheet**, and paste **The style block** followed by
   that effect's block.
4. Save each result under the file name its block gives, all in one folder (say `~/Desktop/ghost-effects/`).
5. Check each one against **What to look for** at the bottom, and regenerate the ones that fail.
6. Hand the folder back and the sprites get cut out and built into the app.

If your tool can export a truly transparent background, use it and delete the BACKGROUND line's green from the style
block. If it can't, leave the green: it is keyed out afterwards.

## The style block (paste at the top of every request)

```
You are drawing a sprite sheet for a mobile messaging app. The app cuts the sheet into separate sprites and animates
them itself, so every sprite must be one complete, separate object.

CHARACTER: the Ghost Messaging ghost, exactly as in the attached reference sheet. A small, friendly, rounded cartoon
ghost: matte white body, two simple oval black eyes, no mouth unless the pose needs one, a scalloped hem of three
curves, no arms unless the pose needs them (then short mitten-like hands). A solid indigo-violet rim (#8C95FF) runs
round its whole silhouette, about 2% of its width.

STYLE: flat, clean, modern, vector-like 3D with soft shading inside each shape. No outlines other than the rim. Bright,
friendly, a little mischievous, never scary.

PALETTE: indigo #4F5BD5, indigo-violet #8C95FF, violet #C77DFF, pale blue-teal #7FE3D4, coral #FF7A6B, rose #FF7AA8,
gold #FFC94D, white, near-black #16181D. Never use green of any kind inside a sprite.

BACKGROUND: one flat colour, pure chroma green #00FF00, from edge to edge. No gradient, no texture, no vignette, no
floor, no horizon, and no shadow cast onto the background.

LAYOUT: exactly 12 sprites in a grid of 4 columns and 3 rows, evenly spaced, one sprite in each cell, centred in its
cell. Sprites never touch or overlap each other or the edge of the canvas: clear green shows all the way round every
sprite. No grid lines, borders, labels, numbers, captions, watermark or text of any kind.

ROW 1: four ghost characters, each filling most of its cell.
ROWS 2 AND 3: eight small props, each filling about two thirds of its cell.

EDGES: crisp, clean silhouettes. No motion blur, no smoke, no haze, no see-through parts, no soft glow spilling onto
the background. Anything that should glow is drawn as a solid lighter shape with a hard edge.

BOTH THEMES: these sprites are shown over a near-white page and over a near-black page. Every white or very pale
shape carries the solid indigo-violet rim. Every near-black shape carries a thin pale rim.

Square image, 1:1, at the highest resolution available.

Row 2: happy (eyes closed in upward curves), surprised (eyes wide and round), sleepy (eyes half closed).

## What to look for

Regenerate a sheet when any of these is true:

- A sprite touches another sprite or the edge of the image.
- The background is not one flat green: there is a gradient, a floor, a shadow or a glow on it.
- There are letters, numbers, labels or grid lines.
- A sprite contains green.
- The ghost doesn't match the reference sheet.
- A white shape has no rim (it would vanish on the light theme).

Twelve sprites exactly is the aim. Eleven or thirteen good ones is fine: the cutting finds each sprite by its shape,
not by counting cells.
