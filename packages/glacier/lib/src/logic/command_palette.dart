/// Command palette logic: the matching, grouping and cursor rules behind a ⌘K overlay.
///
/// A port of `@glacier/logic` (packages/logic/src/command-palette.ts), function for function and line for line where
/// the language allows, so the Flutter palette answers a query with the same list in the same order as the web one.
/// Plain Dart: nothing here knows about widgets.
///
/// What differs from the TypeScript:
/// - `undefined` is `null`.
/// - `isCommandShortcut` takes its three fields as named arguments rather than an event object.
/// - [highlightSegments] slices as JavaScript's `slice` does, clamping to the string, because Dart's `substring`
///   throws where a lower-cased haystack is longer than its label (a dotted capital I) and JavaScript shrugs.
