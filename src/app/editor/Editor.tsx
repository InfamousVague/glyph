/**
 * The editing surface: one CodeMirror view, held outside React.
 *
 * React renders the host element and nothing inside it. That division is not
 * stylistic - the editor's DOM is CodeMirror's, it is reconciled against a
 * document model React knows nothing about, and a re-render that touched it
 * would destroy a selection or a live IME composition. So the view is created
 * once in an effect with an empty dependency list, the `onChange` and `value`
 * props are read through refs, and this component re-renders as often as its
 * parent likes without the editor noticing.
 *
 * `value` is treated as an INITIAL value plus a resync signal: when it differs
 * from what the view holds, the document is replaced (a different note was
 * opened). It is deliberately not a controlled prop in the React sense, because
 * round-tripping every keystroke through a parent's state is exactly the
 * latency this app exists to avoid.
 *
 * So a prop reaches the view in one of three ways, and a caller has to know
 * which. The callbacks (`onChange`, `onImageError`, `swipeAction`, `suggest`,
 * `linkMenus`, `wiki`, `onAiMarks`) are read through refs when they are used.
 * `dark`, `assist`, `readOnly`, `tape`/`tapeId`, `display` and `look` sit in
 * Compartments and are swapped in place when they change. Everything else -
 * `grow`, `arrivals`, `wispTyping`, `ripples`, `peek`, `diagrams`,
 * `placeholder`, and whether `wiki` or `linkMenus` was given at all - is read
 * once, when the view is made, and so are whether `plus` or `blankPage` was
 * given, `openHeading`, which `places` and which `videos`; a caller that needs a different set remounts
 * the editor with a new `key` (src/read/Reader.tsx does). And a new `wiki`
 * object is also a sign the notes changed (below), so a caller keeps the same
 * one while its lookups are the same.
 *
 * markdown.module.css is the markdown renderer's rule book: the classes
 * glyphHighlight.ts, glyphLines.ts and the widgets hand to CodeMirror, and
 * read by ten other files. Only `.editor` is this host's own, and it lives
 * there because the renderer's line rules are written under it.
