/**
 * One note, open: the words in their editor (editor/Editor.tsx), and everything that floats over or beside them.
 *
 * This component owns SAVING, and saving is the part with teeth: the words are kept in a ref, saved on a debounce,
 * and flushed on every way the app can go away and every way off the note this screen offers
 * (editor/useNoteSaving.ts says why). Everything outside the screen that must change the open note asks it rather
 * than writing the store - a rename from the tab comes in as `rename`.
 *
 * One screen shows five things in one place. While a spoken note's tape plays, the transcript - the recording's
 * phrases following the sound - takes the page (Matt: "the default mode whenever we're playing, not a different
 * tab"), and steps aside when it stops. Otherwise the note's own view: its words, or, for a note that is a canvas or a
 * book, the canvas drawn or the book's index, with the JSON or Markdown behind the view switch. The editor stays
 * mounted behind whichever of the others is up, hidden, so nothing typed is lost and its caret keeps its place.
 *
 * The rest is composed here from pieces with one job each: the tools (editor/NoteTools.tsx) and the bookmark behind
 * one of them (editor/useBookmark.ts), the tape and its removal (editor/useNoteTape.ts), the AI in the note
 * (editor/useNoteAi.ts, with the room its strip takes in editor/useStripRoom.ts), pictures and the note's one line
 * of problems (editor/useNotePictures.ts), landing on an item a link pointed at (editor/useLandAt.ts), live sync
 * (editor/useLiveNote.ts), and the ways plugins reach the note (editor/notePlugins.ts).
 *
 * Where the note was written is the screen's own (core/geotag.ts, core/location.ts): the map card at the top of the
 * note with the byline, drawn from the note's tag or from one waiting to be written; the tag written into the front
 * matter through the editor, as one undo step, so the words are untouched and the save is typing's; and the More
 * sheet's Add my location and Remove location. A tag waiting for a recording's better words lands here once the pass
 * has landed or the review has handed back, and a new note's once it has words.
 *
 * So is the + beside an empty line (editor/insertPlus.ts) and its list (editor/AddList.tsx): this screen says when a
 * + may show, opens the list against it, and owns the rows that leave the editor, the picker for a picture, the fix
 * and the name for a place, which lands as a line of its own with its map card under it (`addPlace`), and the Photo
 * Picker for a film, which lands the same way with its card, played here where it is on this phone (`addVideo`).
