/**
 * Boards, shown as boards (docs/BOARDS.md, core/boards.ts).
 *
 * A ```board fence is columns; the items it names are anywhere in the note, each with its anchor. The fence is drawn
 * as a board of cards, the way a table is drawn as a table (editor/tables.ts): the markdown is what is kept and what
 * is edited, and the caret in the fence steps the drawing aside so the lines can be typed.
 *
 * A card IS its item, which is what Matt asked for ("linking the tasks in the board to a task on the page"):
 *
 * - Its tick box is the item's box. Ticking it ticks the line in the note, and moves the card to Done when the board
 *   has such a column. An item with no box - a bullet, a numbered step - is drawn as a card with no box.
 * - Its words are the item's words. Tapping them puts the caret on that line, so the board is a way around the note.
 * - Press and hold picks the card up and it is dragged to where it goes, in its own column or another (Matt: "add a
 *   way to tap and drag to re organize items in lanes"). The chevrons do the same a tap at a time, for a hand that
 *   would rather not drag and for anything driving the app by keyboard.
 * - A card whose item is gone is drawn with its anchor and nothing else, so it can be seen and taken out.
 *
 * The rest is the phone it is used on (Matt: "make the UI / UX of these boards friendlier on mobile"): columns that
 * snap as they scroll, a heading that stays while the cards go by, an empty column that says it will take a card, a
 * + that writes a new item into the note, and targets big enough for a thumb.
 *
 * This is the extension and what decides where a board is drawn. Its parts are in editor/boards/: the widget
 * (widget.ts) and what a card does to the note (cardEdits.ts), the card's menu (cardMenu.ts), the drag (drag.ts), the
 * + field (composer.ts), the board's height held and remembered (height.ts) and set by the line under it
 * (divider.ts), getting around from a card (navigate.ts), the anchors in the note's lines (anchors.ts), the touch-safe
 * button every control is (press.ts), the icons (icons.ts) and the look (theme.ts).

 * each item's line, counting from 1, and the state its box is being set to; several at once are fine.
 *
 * An item that is not a card, ticked in a list whose neighbours are on a board, joins that board in Done, and its
 * line gains the anchor that names it (core/boards.ts `settleTicks`).

 * Put them in the same transaction as the boxes themselves, so the note and its boards change together, as one undo.
