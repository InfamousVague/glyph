// The settings vocabulary: a port of the web app's src/app/settings/kit/settingsKit.tsx with the `setk-*` rules of
// settings.css that dress it. Every pane says what it says through these, so the panes cannot each grow a dialect:
// one card (PaneSection), one row (SettingRow), one hero, one callout, one empty state, one footnote.
//
// Each class is one export of settingsKit.tsx, and each number is the stylesheet's own, read through the tokens.
// What the page does with selectors is done here with two small scopes:
// - a pane (`.settingsScreen__pane`) is a [SettingsPaneScope], which the screen puts over a section's page. Inside
//   one, a row's icon wears its chip in the section's colour, the cards arrive one after another, and a part can be
//   found by its name and lit (`[data-found]`);
// - a card (`.setk__card`) is a `GlacierScope(classes: {'setk__card'})`, which is how a segmented control on it gets
//   the deeper track settings.css gives it (../settings_css.dart).

/// 1rem: the page's own text size, which a rule that sets no `font-size` inherits.
double _rem(Tokens t) => t.lenOf('1rem');

/// [style] in another weight of its face (`font-weight` on text that otherwise inherits its font).
