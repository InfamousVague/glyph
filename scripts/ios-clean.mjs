/**
 * Clears the copied iOS build artifacts before a build.
 *
 * Tauri's iOS build finishes by `rename()`-ing the app Xcode produced into
 * `src-tauri/gen/apple/build/<target>/`. On macOS `rename()` fails with
 * ENOTEMPTY when the destination directory already exists and has anything in
 * it - so the FIRST build of a target works and every one after it dies with:
 *
 *     failed to rename app .../Glyph.app: Directory not empty (os error 66)
 *
 * The build itself has already succeeded by then, which is what makes it
 * confusing: the log says `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` a few lines above the error.
 *
 * This is cheap. Only the final copied bundles live here; the compiled objects
 * are in DerivedData and are untouched, so a cleaned rebuild re-links and
 * re-copies rather than recompiling the Rust and the Swift from scratch.
